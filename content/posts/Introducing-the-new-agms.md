Last weekend, the Dynamic Toastmasters Committee held their annual general meeting (AGM). The meeting was not only filled with bittersweet moments as outgoing AGM committee members reminisce on their duties over the past year but a palbable excitement as well as plans for the following year were outlined.

Plans that will be going into effect immediately with the creation of multiple new platforms and avenues for member to not only track their progress but showcase their talents to the public. But we won't talk too much about that here as the purpose of this post is about the celebration of the hard work of those who came before us.
